Messaging & Value Proposition

Your headline should speak directly to the developer or health AI builder. Example:

“The fastest self-serve API for ICD-10 & CPT coding — build in minutes.”

Make the link to ICD-10 & CPT very clear in the header (developers should know exactly what the product is at a glance).

Incorporate a short tagline/sub-heading:

“Get accurate diagnosis & procedure codes. No contracts. Ready in 5 minutes.”

Add a quick bullet list of benefits:

Free tier to start

Instant API key & full docs

Pay-as-you-go pricing

Developer SDKs + examples

Consider adding a short line about your founder/health-AI background: builds trust.

🧱 Structure & Navigation

Ensure top navigation includes: Home → Docs → Pricing → Dashboard → Support

Use a “Get Started / Sign Up” button prominently in the header (sticky) so devs can go straight to onboarding.

On the home page include a small code snippet near the top to hook technical users (e.g., curl https://api.nuvii.ai/v1/icd10/search?query=hypertension ).

Add a “How it works” section with 3-4 steps:

Sign up & get API key

Integrate in minutes

Query codes / suggestions

Scale with usage

Add a “Use Cases” section: Telehealth assistants, Clinical documentation tools, Billing automation, Research pipelines.

Add a “Customers” or “Testimonials” section (even if initial logos or quotes) — social proof matters.

Make sure footer has links: Privacy, Terms, Docs, GitHub (if open), Contact support.

🎨 UX / Design & Branding

Use the color palette we discussed: #1A73E8 (primary blue) as accent for call-to-action buttons, #10B981 for success states, etc.

Ensure typography is developer-friendly: code samples use a monospace font, body uses Inter or similar.

Use plenty of white space — developers expect clean docs.

For the hero section, include either a simple illustration or icon representing “coding” + “health” (e.g., a code bracket + stethoscope or healthcare cross).

Make the site mobile responsive — many developers check from multiple devices.

Use interactive elements: e.g., “Try it now” inline sandbox / API playground with live call (even if limited) to demonstrate instant value.

⚙️ Developer Journey & Onboarding

Provide clear “Sign Up → Get API Key” flow. Possibly allow OAuth or email only to reduce friction.

Onboarding email: Immediately send API key + link to “first request” example + Pantheon of examples.

Documentation should include: REST endpoints, parameters, sample responses, error codes, SDK links (Python, JS).

Add “Quickstart” section: 5 minutes to first code, 3 lines of code sample.

Include usage limits, rate-limiting rules, status page link.

Provide code snippet for each major use case: search by code, search by description, suggestions from text.

Dashboard: usage chart (calls used vs plan), current plan, upgrade button, log of last requests (IDs, timestamps).

💵 Pricing & Conversion Optimization

Keep pricing simple and visible on home page (not buried).

Show Free tier prominently.

Show comparison table: Free, Starter, Growth, Enterprise.

Show clear CTA on pricing page.

Consider “Start with Free Tier” rather than “Contact Sales” for first two tiers.

Clearly show what happens when you exceed limits (e.g., $/1k additional calls).

Add badge or highlight: “No contract. Cancel any time.”

Show uptime/SLAs (if published) — developers care.

Use a payment processor like Stripe; make upgrading smooth.

Consider launching a referral or “invite a friend” program for early traction.

📈 SEO & Content Strategy

Use keywords in headings/meta: “ICD-10 API”, “CPT coding API”, “medical coding API for developers”.

Publish regular blog posts/tutorials: e.g., “How to auto-suggest CPT codes in a telehealth app”, “Reducing coding errors with API in clinical docs”, etc.

Link to your GitHub or examples repository.

Publish case studies once you have early adopters.

Add structured data (JSON-LD) with Organization + SoftwareApplication markup for better indexing.

🛡️ Trust & Compliance Signals

Add a badge or section about security/privacy: “All API calls encrypted”, “No PHI stored”, “GDPR/HIPAA-ready”.

Add Privacy Policy / Terms of Service pages.

Consider adding a “Status” link or badge (UptimeRobot) to convey reliability.

Show versioning of your API (v1, v2) and backward-compatibility commitment.
