## 🎯 My Recommendation for You

### Choose AWS Free Tier Because:

1. **You have a real domain (nuvii.ai)**
   - This is a serious project, not a hobby

2. **FREE for 12 months**
   - Perfect time to build your user base
   - By month 12, you should have paying customers

3. **Professional infrastructure**
   - Looks better to investors/partners
   - Industry-standard skills

4. **It's not that hard**
   - I've written a step-by-step guide
   - You'll learn valuable skills
   - Takes 2-3 hours total

5. **Scales with you**
   - When you get 1000 users, AWS handles it
   - No migration needed

### Timeline Comparison

**AWS:**
- Day 1: 2-3 hours setup
- Day 2-365: FREE
- Year 2: ~$30-50/month (but you have customers!)

**Railway:**
- Day 1: 30 minutes setup
- Day 1-365: $5-20/month = $60-240
- Year 2: Same or more

**Savings with AWS:** $60-240 in first year
